# 📘 Day 12 – NULL Values and IS NULL / IS NOT NULL 🎯

# 🚀 Objective
Learn how to properly handle NULL values in SQL using IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, and COALESCE to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

# 📚 Topics Covered
- NULL handling – understanding missing or unknown data
- IS NULL – identify records with NULL values
- IS NOT NULL – filter records where values exist
- COALESCE – replace NULLs with default values for cleaner outputs

🧠 Practice Questions
1. Find all weeks in the services_weekly table where no special event occurred.
2. Count how many records have null or empty event values.
3. List all services that had at least one week with a special event.

🏆 Daily Challenge
Analyze the event impact by comparing weeks with events vs weeks without events. Show: event status ('With Event' or 'No Event'), count of weeks, average patient satisfaction, and average staff morale. Order the results by average patient satisfaction in descending order.
