# 📘 Day 10 – CASE Statements 🎯

## 🚀 Objective
Master the use of **CASE WHEN** statements in SQL — essential for applying conditional logic, creating derived columns, and categorizing data effectively.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- **CASE WHEN** – apply conditional logic within queries  
- **Derived Columns** – create new columns based on existing data  
- **Conditional Aggregation** – categorize and summarize data dynamically  

## 🧠 Practice Questions
1. Categorize patients as `'High'`, `'Medium'`, or `'Low'` satisfaction based on their scores.  
2. Label staff roles as `'Medical'` or `'Support'` based on role type.  
3. Create age groups for patients:  
   - `0–18`  
   - `19–40`  
   - `41–65`  
   - `65+`  

## 🏆 Daily Challenge
**Question:**  
Create a **service performance report** showing:  
- **Service Name**  
- **Total Patients Admitted**  
- **Performance Category**, based on the following logic:
  - `'Excellent'` if average satisfaction ≥ 85  
  - `'Good'` if average satisfaction ≥ 75  
  - `'Fair'` if average satisfaction ≥ 65  
  - Otherwise `'Needs Improvement'`
