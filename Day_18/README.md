# 📘 Day 18 – UNION & UNION ALL
# 🚀 Objective
Understand how to use UNION and UNION ALL to combine result sets, merge datasets, and build unified outputs across multiple tables.

# 📚 Topics Covered
- UNION
- UNION ALL
- Combining result sets
- Removing vs. retaining duplicates
- Creating unified directories from multiple tables

# 🧠 Practice Questions
1. Combine patient names and staff names into a single list.
2. Create a union of high satisfaction patients (>90) and low satisfaction patients (<50).
3. List all unique names from both patients and staff tables.

# 🏆 Daily Challenge
Create a comprehensive personnel and patient list showing: identifier (patient_id or staff_id), full name, type ('Patient' or 'Staff'), and associated service. Include only those in 'surgery' or 'emergency' services. Order by type, then service, then name.
