# 📘 Day 21 – Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
# 🚀 Objective
Learn how to use CTEs to simplify complex SQL queries, improve readability, and structure multi-step logic. You will work with single CTEs, multiple chained CTEs, and (optionally) recursive CTEs to build organized analytical queries.

# 📚 Topics Covered
- The WITH clause
- Single and multiple CTEs
- Using CTEs to break down complex transformations
- Joining CTEs together
- Recursive CTEs (if needed)
- Building layered logic for dashboards and analytics

# 🧠 Practice Questions
1. Create a CTE to calculate service statistics, then query results from it.
2. Use multiple CTEs to break a complex analytical query into clear logical steps.
3. Build a staff-utilization CTE and join it with patient demographic or satisfaction data.

# 🏆 Daily Challenge
Create a comprehensive hospital performance dashboard using CTEs. 
Calculate: 
1) Service-level metrics (total admissions, refusals, avg satisfaction),
2) Staff metrics per service (total staff, avg weeks present),
3) Patient demographics per service (avg age, count).
Then combine all three CTEs to create a final report showing service name, all calculated metrics, and an overall performance score (weighted average of admission rate and satisfaction). Order by performance score descending.
