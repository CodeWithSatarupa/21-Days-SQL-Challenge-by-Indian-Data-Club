# 📘 Day 16 – Subqueries (WHERE Clause) 🔍

# 🚀 Objective
Learn how to use subqueries in the WHERE clause to filter data based on complex conditions or aggregated results from another query, enabling more advanced and dynamic data retrieval.

# 📚 Topics Covered
- Subqueries in the WHERE clause
- Nested queries for more complex conditions
- Filtering with subqueries to refine the main query based on other query results
- Using aggregates like AVG() inside subqueries for comparison with main query conditions
- IN, EXISTS, and other subquery operators for handling multiple results

# 🧠 Practice Questions
1. Find patients who are in services with an above-average staff count.
2. List staff who work in services that had any week with patient satisfaction below 70.
3. Show patients from services where total admitted patients exceed 1000.

# 🏆 Daily Challenge
Find all patients who were admitted to services that had at least one week where patients were refused AND the average patient satisfaction for that service was below the overall hospital average satisfaction.
