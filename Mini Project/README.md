# 🍕 The Great Pizza Analytics Challenge
A hands-on SQL project from the Great Pizza Analytics Challenge with DPDzero and Indian Data Club, focused on exploring pizza sales data and generating actionable insights.

# 🚀 Project Overview
I analyzed pizza categories, size preferences, pricing trends, and peak sales periods to uncover customer behaviour and business opportunities. The project involved connecting tables, cleaning data, summarizing trends, and turning raw numbers into actionable insights.
The CSV files used for this project are included in the datasets/ folder.

# 📊 Key Insights

- Price differences highlighted upsell opportunities.
- Weekend evenings were peak sales times, ideal for promotions and staffing.
