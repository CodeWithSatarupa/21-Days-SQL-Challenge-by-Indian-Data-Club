# 📘 Day 17 – Subqueries (SELECT & FROM Clause)
# 🚀 Objective
Understand how to use subqueries inside SELECT, derived tables, and inline views to perform advanced calculations, comparisons, and analytics directly within SQL queries.

# 📚 Topics Covered
- Subqueries in the SELECT clause
- Subqueries in the FROM clause (derived tables / inline views)
- Using subqueries to compute group-level statistics
- Combining aggregates with CASE expressions
- Analytical reporting using nested logic

# 🧠 Practice Questions
1. Show each patient with their service's average satisfaction as an additional column.
2. Create a derived table of service statistics (e.g., total patients, avg satisfaction, staff count) and query from it.
3. Display staff with their service's total patient count as a calculated field using a subquery.

# 🏆 Daily Challenge
Create a report showing each service with the following details:
Service name , Total patients admitted , Difference between each service's total admissions and the average admissions across all services
A rank indicator based on performance: Above Average , Average , Below Average
Order the report by total patients admitted (descending)
