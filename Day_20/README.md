# 📘 Day 20 – Window Functions (Aggregate Window Functions)
# 🚀 Objective
Learn how to use SQL aggregate window functions such as SUM() OVER and AVG() OVER to perform running totals, moving averages, and comparative analytics across partitions and ordered datasets.

# 📚 Topics Covered
- SUM() OVER
- AVG() OVER
- Running totals
- Moving averages
- Window frames (ROWS BETWEEN…)
- Trend and time-series analysis

# 🧠 Practice Questions
1. Calculate the running total of patients admitted by week for each service.
2. Find the moving average of patient satisfaction over 4-week periods.
3. Show cumulative patient refusals by week across all services.

# 🏆 Daily Challenge
Create a trend analysis showing for each service and week: week_number , patients_admitted , running total of patients admitted (cumulative) , 3-week moving average of patient satisfaction (current week and 2 prior weeks)) , and thedifference between current week admissions and the service average.
Filter for weeks 10-20 only.
